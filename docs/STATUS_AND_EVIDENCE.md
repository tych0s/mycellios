# Status and evidence

Updated: 2026-08-31.

## Implemented and connected

- model profiling, certified adapters and contiguous range planning;
- deterministic runtime manifests and launch descriptions;
- local and authenticated HTTP launch agents;
- staged startup, readiness, canary, registration and cleanup;
- streaming API and persistent runtime transport;
- direct-channel selection with bounded relay fallback;
- recovery orchestration and execution traces;
- commit-first activation-integrity sketches with a Torch-free control-plane
  verifier and optional binding inside signed physical receipts;
- physical campaign, evidence import and gate-report tooling.

## Verified in automated or single-host runs

- selective Llama and Qwen-family pipelines;
- real subprocesses and sockets on one host;
- CPU pipeline parity and greedy kill-and-resume recovery;
- local direct/relay transport behavior and rejection paths;
- tensor/expert cell contracts and supported CPU fixtures;
- coordinator, worker, activation, security and packaging policies.

The normal test suite validates software behavior. Opt-in physical tests are
skipped when their required model, GPU or host environment is unavailable.

## Not yet demonstrated by committed evidence

- one inference route spanning two physical computers;
- a model that requires the combined memory of several hosts;
- GPU tensor or expert parallelism across machines;
- remote recovery after physically losing a stage;
- P50/P95 latency and sustained throughput on residential LAN/WAN;
- a reproducible comparison showing that Mycellios outperforms another system.
- activation-integrity enforcement using a distinct trusted recompute stage on
  a physical route (the contract exists, but no such receipt is committed).

## Evidence policy

A physical claim is accepted only when the artifact records at least:

- commit/build and model artifact identities;
- distinct machine identities and assigned layer ranges;
- transport mode and directed link measurements;
- exact canary/parity result;
- TTFT, TPOT, tokens per second and peak memory;
- process cleanup, plus the outcome of an intentional failure when recovery is
  claimed.

Existing files in `benchmarks/` are retained local/loopback evidence. They are
useful regression baselines, but none proves a two-computer route.

## Benchmark taxonomy

Physical reports separate control overhead, process startup, model loading,
activation transfer, TTFT, TPOT, sustained tokens/s, peak memory, cleanup and
recovery. Every result is bound to an exact source/build, operating systems,
hardware and drivers, model revision, assigned ranges, topology and transport.
An optimization comparison uses the same model and topology on both sides and
must retain output parity; loopback measurements cannot establish a multi-host
performance claim.

## Next gate

Run the native contiguous pipeline on two computers using
[`TWO_HOST_QUICKSTART.md`](TWO_HOST_QUICKSTART.md). Do not add a new engine or a
new product surface before that run identifies a concrete missing capability.
